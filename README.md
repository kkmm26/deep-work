# Story

I've used several task management apps like Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, and Notion. While these tools are powerful and useful, I've often found myself switching between them, trying to find the perfect fit. Lately, though, I've noticed that I mostly just use the default Notepad and, occasionally, a couple of pages in Notion for scheduling and goal tracking.

I've come to realize that most productivity apps are overkill for my needs. So, I've decided to combine the simplicity of Notepad with the functionalities of more robust apps to to implement Deep Work principles while optimizing for productivity.
